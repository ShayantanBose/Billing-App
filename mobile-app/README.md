# Billing App Mobile

This is a standalone React Native mobile application for the Billing App. It runs entirely on the device and communicates directly with Google Services using user-provided credentials.

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your Android device.

## Configuration

On the first launch, go to **Settings**:

1.  **Spreadsheet ID:** The ID of your Google Sheet.
2.  **Google Doc ID:** The ID of the Google Doc for images.
3.  **Drive Folder ID:** The ID of the Google Drive folder for uploads.
4.  **Credentials JSON:** Paste the content of your `credentials.json` file (from Google Cloud Console).
5.  **Token JSON:** Paste the content of your `token.json` file (generated by the backend script previously, or generate a new one).

## Building APK

To build a standalone APK for Android:

1.  Install EAS CLI: `npm install -g eas-cli`
2.  Login: `eas login`
3.  Configure: `eas build:configure`
4.  Build:
    ```bash
    eas build -p android --profile preview
    ```
    Or for a local build (requires Android SDK):
    ```bash
    npx expo run:android --variant release
    ```

## Architecture

*   **No Backend:** The app communicates directly with Google APIs.
*   **Local Storage:** Credentials and configs are stored securely on the device.
*   **OCR:** Uses Tesseract.js (or native equivalent) for on-device text recognition.
